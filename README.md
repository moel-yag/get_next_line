# get_next_line

## Project Overview
`get_next_line` is a project that implements a function that reads a line from a file descriptor (usually `STDIN`, a file, or a socket) one line at a time. The function is designed to read input until it encounters a newline (`\n`) character, allowing the program to process input line-by-line.

This function is useful for applications that need to process large amounts of data or text input in a more efficient, memory-conscious manner, such as reading from log files, text files, or network streams.

## Function Prototype
```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```
## Parameters:

    fd: The file descriptor from which to read. This could represent a file, STDIN, or any other input stream.

## Return Value:

    Returns a dynamically allocated string containing the next line of text from the file descriptor.
    Returns NULL when there is no more data to read (e.g., end of file or error).

## Requirements

    The function must be able to handle any size of file or input stream.
    The function should read and return one line at a time.
    The function must handle large input efficiently by using memory allocation.
    It must not use the standard library function get_next_line or similar high-level I/O functions.

## Memory Management:

    The function should handle memory properly, freeing the memory used to store lines when no longer needed.
    After returning a line, it should maintain state across multiple calls to continue reading from the same file descriptor.
## Compilation

To compile the project, use the following make command:
```bash
make
```
This will compile the get_next_line function into an object file (get_next_line.o) and create an executable or static library depending on your setup.
## Test the Implementation:

After compiling the project, you can create a test file (test.c) that uses the get_next_line function to read and print lines from a file.
Example test.c:
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("test_file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);  // Print the line
        free(line);  // Free the memory allocated for the line
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

## Function Prototype
```c

Parameters:

    fd: The file descriptor from which to read. This could represent a file, STDIN, or any other input stream.

Return Value:

    Returns a dynamically allocated string containing the next line of text from the file descriptor.
    Returns NULL when there is no more data to read (e.g., end of file or error).

Requirements

    The function must be able to handle any size of file or input stream.
    The function should read and return one line at a time.
    The function must handle large input efficiently by using memory allocation.
    It must not use the standard library function get_next_line or similar high-level I/O functions.

Memory Management:

    The function should handle memory properly, freeing the memory used to store lines when no longer needed.
    After returning a line, it should maintain state across multiple calls to continue reading from the same file descriptor.

Compilation

To compile the project, use the following make command:
```bash
make
```
This will compile the get_next_line function into an object file (get_next_line.o) and create an executable or static library depending on your setup.
Test the Implementation:

After compiling the project, you can create a test file (test.c) that uses the get_next_line function to read and print lines from a file.

Example test.c:
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("test_file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);  // Print the line
        free(line);  // Free the memory allocated for the line
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
To compile and run the test program:
```bash
gcc -o test test.c get_next_line.o
./test
```
Make sure test_file.txt exists with some content to test the reading functionality.
## Algorithm

    Buffering: The function uses a buffer to store incoming data from the file descriptor in chunks.
    Reading Until Newline: The function reads from the file descriptor until it encounters a newline character (\n) or reaches the end of the file.
    Memory Allocation: Each line is stored in a dynamically allocated string, and the previous content is retained in memory to be processed during the next call to get_next_line.
    End of File (EOF): Once the end of the file is reached or no more data is available, the function returns NULL to signal the end.
## Key Points:

    The function is stateful, meaning it "remembers" where it left off when reading data from the file descriptor.
    Efficiency is critical. By reading data in manageable chunks, the function can handle large files or input streams without consuming excessive memory.
    Memory management must be handled carefully to avoid memory leaks, especially when dynamically allocating memory for each line.

## Files

    get_next_line.c: Contains the implementation of the get_next_line function.
    get_next_line.h: The header file with the function prototype and necessary includes.
    Makefile: The file used for building the project.
## Usage

To use the get_next_line function, include the get_next_line.h header file in your C source code, and call the function as needed:
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main() {
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", line);  // Process the line (e.g., print it)
        free(line);  // Don't forget to free the memory!
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
Important Notes:

    Always free the memory allocated by get_next_line after use to prevent memory leaks.
    If the file descriptor is invalid or there is an error while reading, the function will return NULL.
## Example Output

Assuming test_file.txt contains:

Hello, world!
This is a test file.
It contains multiple lines.
End of file.

Running the test program will produce:

Hello, world!
This is a test file.
It contains multiple lines.
End of file.

### What You Should Customize:
- Update any file or function names based on your specific implementation (e.g., if you separate certain functions into multiple files or if your headers differ).
- Modify the example `test.c` or provide any additional test cases that are relevant to your specific project.
- If your version includes special features (e.g., buffer size customization or error handling), make sure to mention those in the `Algorithm` section.

Let me know if you'd like to add any additional details!
